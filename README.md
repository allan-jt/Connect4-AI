# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game where the user can play (and lose) against the computer.  I have two goals behind this project:
1. Learn the basics of Python programming in terms of syntax, OOP, algorithms, libraries, and graphics
2. Explore basic AI algorithms by implementing the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to decide what moves the computer should play
