# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple tic-tac-toe game where the user can play (and lose) against the computer.  I have three goals behind this project:
1. Learn the basics of Python programming in terms of syntax, OOP, algorithms, libraries, and graphics
2. Explore AI by implementing the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) to decide what moves the computer should play
3. Learn to code in a widely accepted style ([Official style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements), [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), [Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/))
