# Connect4
This is a Connect4 game where the user can play (and lose) against the computer.  I have three goals behind this project:
1. Learn the fundementals of Python in terms of syntax, OOP, algorithms, data structures, libraries, and more
2. Explore AI by implementing the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to decide the computer's moves
3. Adopt best practices in Python programming ([Official style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements), [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), [Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/))
